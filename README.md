GS_13 Reddit knock-off using API calls to the AWW subreddit

CHEAP REDDIT

Task: Create a webpage that displays the posts from the AWW Subreddit.

Build Specifications:
1. Use jQuery to request data from the https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/.json API.
2. Display the results on the page.
3. At a minimum, include a title, image and working link for each post. (Easiest is to use the
thumbnail for the image, but there are other images in the JSON response.)
4. Make it look good with some CSS.

Bonus
Only show the first ten results.
